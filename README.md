🚀 Currently navigating the world of code as an undergrad at IIT BHU Varanasi,evolving through the twists and turns of an Integrated Dual Degree.

💡 I thrive on curiosity and am diving deep into the realms of React and Node.js, uncovering their secrets one line at a time.

💬 Let's chat about the art of code, whether it's the dance of React, the elegance of Django, or the mysteries of SQL.

🌍 I'm just an email away at tejasbhausaheb.more.cse21@itbhu.ac.in, and you can also explore my journey further,my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tQxE-5q7JTYRNhuVOU80PTBM7hdOJbcS/view?usp=sharing).

💻 My tools of choice:
   - Crafting spells with JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, Python, C++.
   - Building castles with Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap.
   - Diving into databases like an archaeologist with MongoDB, and MySQL.
   - Forging kingdoms on the backend with Node.js, Express.js, Django.
   - Hosting my creations in the clouds with Vercel, GitHub Pages, and Netlify.
   - NPM is my trusty wand, and I'm a Git sorcerer practicing the ancient arts of GitHub, Linux.

🎨 I don't just code; I paint digital dreams and engineer experiences that spark wonder.

🔝 Here are some of the enchanted languages and repositories I've conjured:
